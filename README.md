## Inspiration
"Health is wealth" — a phrase we’ve all heard, yet the true weight of it only struck us when we lost loved ones during the pandemic and to other health conditions. In those difficult moments, the biggest frustration wasn’t just the loss — it was not knowing why. Not understanding the cause, the condition, or what could have been done differently.

This pain, this confusion, and this helplessness became personal to us. And from that place, the idea for MEDIMENTOR was born.

## What it does

We built an AI-powered engine designed to bridge the gap between complex medical information and everyday understanding.

MEDIMENTOR takes ambiguous, technical lab results and transforms them into clear, easy-to-understand explanations.

Use Case 1: Translating Lab Results into Plain Language
Medical lab reports are often filled with complex, technical terms that can be difficult to interpret. MEDIMENTOR takes those ambiguous lab results and explains them in simple, easy-to-understand language — just like a friend would. We ensure that users not only know what their results mean but also understand how it might affect their health.

Use Case 2: Recommending the Right Healthcare Provider
Understanding your results is only the first step. MEDIMENTOR goes a step further by identifying the type of specialist or provider a user may need to consult based on their lab results.
For example, if your HbA1c level is high, MEDIMENTOR will explain what that means and recommend consulting an endocrinologist, allowing you to directly schedule an appointment from the platform.
This makes the journey from diagnosis to treatment faster, clearer, and more connected.

## How we built it
- The website frontend was made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS.
- The website backend was made using Java and Springboot.
- Gihub repo can be found on https://github.com/saloni0104/MediMentor
- We also used FHIR API from PhenoML mainly 
- Design was done using Canva
- Overall, it was a great learning experience trying our hands on several new software and building the site from scratch during the weekend.

## Challenges we ran into
- Coming up with the idea was not the difficult part but navigating the execution was.
- Fitting PhenoML APIs into the application to make the user journey more smoother was challenging.
- PhenoML had too much to offer but prioritising and shorlisting the most optimal usecases for our project took some time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to successfully leverage PhenoML technologies and integrate them in our project.
- We are proud to have worked on a problem that impacts millions of lives in the field of healthcare everyday.
- Through this project, we stepped into the shoes of patients and understood the niche pain points that they have in understanding basic medical needs like understanding lab reports in common terminology and identifying the correct provider based on symptoms and emotions.

## What we learned
- We learnt to use PhenoML product and different APIs that PhenoML offers.
- We learnt to use Springboot and integration with PhenoML for our usecas


## What's next for MediMentor
- Improve Appointment discovery.
- Handwritten prescriptions converted into Printed readable format.
- Knowing the correct prescriptions for general and branded medicines.
